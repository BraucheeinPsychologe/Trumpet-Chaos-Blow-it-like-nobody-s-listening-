# Description
Hit the notes? Stay on beat? Forget it.
Trumpet Chaos throws you into a musical mess where the only rule is: blow hard and embrace the madness!

Control your trumpet with your mouse or finger, slide up and down to match the notes — or completely miss them in glorious, honking disaster.
Unlock ridiculous skins, from classy gold to cardboard trash. Score points, create beautiful chaos, and maybe, just maybe, master the art of the toot.
